        <h1>Winston Surfshirt</h1>
        <h2>Sponge Cake</h2>
        <p>The Sydney six piece band have delivered my favourite summer 'chill' record of 2017.  Discovered through the likes of Triple J Unearthed, the band is possibly best defined as funk/soul/hip-hop. â€˜Spongecakeâ€™ is their debut and itâ€™s a strong start.  Highly infectious soul and whilst thereâ€™s nothing overly complex going on, itâ€™s a fun, breezy album to listen to with the singles â€˜Same Sameâ€™, â€˜Ali Dâ€™ and â€˜Be About Youâ€™ being the stand outs. Sometimes itâ€™s not all about the technical brilliance or the lyrics, it just has to work and for me, â€˜Spongecakeâ€™ sits well.</p>

        <h1>The xx</h1>
        <h2>I See You</h2>
        <p>Five years after the brilliant, â€˜Coexistâ€™, the English trio with amazing voices return with â€˜I See Youâ€™ â€” one of their most personal records to date. Jamie xxâ€™s influence from his record â€˜In Colorâ€™ is prevalent throughout with his electronic rhythms grounding the songs well. Since they released â€˜Coexistâ€™ weâ€™ve seen the likes of <em>London Grammar</em> and other indie bands try and share some of <em>The xx</em>â€™s vibe but the English trio continue to delve deeper and arguably offer more profound levels of emotion. Their singles â€˜Say Something Lovingâ€™ and â€˜On Holdâ€™ are brilliant examples of modern indie songwriting.</p>

        <h1>Kendrick Lamar</h1>
        <h2>DAMN.</h2>
        <p>â€˜Damn.â€™ is my favourite hip-hop album of 2017 and arguably the best. This is Kendrick in his prime, his most succinct, and possibly his most commercial. Kendrick has always been a strong storyteller and working with a plethora on heavyweight producers, he unleashes new energetic heights with the likes of singles such as â€˜DNAâ€™, â€˜LOYALTYâ€™, and â€˜HUMBLEâ€™, the latter being one of my favourite songs of the year. The way he weaves the complex, the lyrics, the beats, and his point of view, is timely yet old school. In some ways, the album feels both at times likes underground 90â€™s/00â€™s hip-hop yet completely 2017.</p>

        <h1>The War On Drugs</h1>
        <h2>A Deeper Understanding</h2>
        <p>The first couple of times I listened to â€˜A Deeper Understandingâ€™, I felt like it was a step down from their brilliant 2014 record â€˜Lost in The Dreamâ€™. My favourite record of 2014 and perhaps the past five or so years, how could it be topped? Well, â€˜A Deeper Understandingâ€™ doesnâ€™t quite reach those heights but the more I listen, the more I love it. So much so, itâ€™s been on constant rotation from beginning to end because thatâ€™s the best way to listen to any <em>War on Drugs</em> record. It feels like an excellent companion to their 2014 release, and on occasion, even better. â€˜Holding Onâ€™ is one excellent single but itâ€™s the epic 11 minute â€˜Thinking of a Placeâ€™ that feels like when the band are at their peak.</p>

        <h1>The National</h1>
        <h2>Sleep Well Beast</h2>
        <p>I make no secret that I'm a massive <em>The National</em> fan. I've seen them perform three times, the first time when touring 'Boxer', a record that holds a very special place and at very influential time in my life. Since then, each album has been phenomenal, some more upbeat than others. â€˜Sleep Well Beastâ€™ might the closest material theyâ€™ve released since â€˜Boxerâ€™ that feels like a complete band energised and firing on all cylinders. That said, donâ€™t expect things to be all rosy in the lyrical department because what goes up, often comes down. Therein lies in the genius with <em>The National</em>. They make you feel every inch of your bones and thatâ€™s why â€˜Sleep Well Beastâ€™ is my favourite album of 2017.</p>
